# Blockchain Commons Airgapped Signing

## Mission

**Airgapped Signing** is a community of cryptocurrency wallet developers, sharing best practices and interoperability for airgapped QR code communications between multiple vendors on multiple platforms. These best practices include support for hot, cold and multisig cryptographic wallets, research & proposals for data formats and protocols, security and UX for multisig work flows, and other key management and signing issues and topics.

## Discussions

### Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Wallet Standard Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions). For standards and open-source developers who want to talk about wallet standards, please use the Discussions area of the [Airgapped Signing repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning). This is where you can talk about projects like our [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) and command line tools such as [seedtool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli), both of which are intended to testbed wallet technologies, plus the libraries that we've built to support your own deployment of wallet technology such as [bc-bip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bip39), [bc-slip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-slip39), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Shamir Secret Key Recovery](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur), and the [bc-crypto-base](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-crypto-base). If it's a wallet-focused technology or a more general discussion of wallet standards,discuss it here.
