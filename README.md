# Blockchain Commons Airgapped Signing

## Mission

**Airgapped Signing** is a community of cryptocurrency wallet developers, sharing best practices and interoperability for airgapped QR code communications between multiple vendors on multiple platforms. These best practices include support for hot, cold and multisig cryptographic wallets, research & proposals for data formats and protocols, security and UX for multisig work flows, and other key management and signing issues and topics.

## Discussions

To date we have been holding discussions on these topics in an invite-only semi-private Signal group chat, and in [open issues](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/issues) in this repository, as well as a variety of research, proposals and POCs in other repositories.

As of the end of August we now have access to a new GitHub feature [Discussions](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions) and we will be moving more of our conversations there.
